                <p>The 1980s saw the rise of many different things. One of the 
                of the industry's first was publishing houses such as Sony,
                Apple, Microsoft, and Activision-Blizzard</p>
                
                <p>Besides the publishing houseses, this era also saw the small 
                beginnings of online gaming and handheld lcd games. Though this
                was great and all, there was soon a "crash" of the video game 
                industry that on one hand bankrupted several companies but led to
                the popularity of Japanese companies Nintendo and Sega</p>
                
                <p>After the crash, soon the third and fourth generation of 
                consoles came such as the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES),
                SG-1000, Sega Genesis, and Super NES. These has led to famous 
                franchises such as The Legend of Zelda, Dragon Quest, Phantasy 
                Star, and Final Fantasy.</p>
                
                <p>The 90's brought many innovations in the gaming industry.
                There was a transition to 3D graphics and led to several genres 
                such as first-person shooters, real-time strategy, and MMOS.</p>
                
                <p>First mentioned in the Golden Age page, arcades and arcades 
                games made a suprising comeback. Afterwards, Nintendo released 
                the Game Boy and its succesors, the Game Boy Pocket, Color, and
                Advance. Besides handhelds, PC Gaming saw a boost in hardware and 
                and saw a rise of small developers such as Apogee, Epic MegaGames,
                Maxis, and id Software. </p>
